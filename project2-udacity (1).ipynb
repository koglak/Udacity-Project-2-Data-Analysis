I first decided to separate categories. For example, If a movie labeled as Drama and Romance, I thought I can add 2 line for this movie, first one is Drama, second one is Romance. But that seemed to me complicated and I gave up. \n- Later I decided to use genres which has more samples than others. \n- Some categories has 1 sample. 1 sample is not enough to answer this question.\n- I faced some difficulties when I tried to plot graphics. It was usually lack of practice. Later I overwhelmed.\n\n\n# **Question 2:**\n\n**My observations:**\n* I tried to observe if budget effects popularity of a movie.\n* In this case, I wanted to analysis comedy category because this category had greater sample than others.\n* When I plotted budget vs popularity, I could not observe any logical result.\n* So I decided to divide popularity to 1,2,3,4,5,6 category and I took mean of budget for each range.\n* Latest graphic showed that there is not linear/bounded relationship between this 2 category.\n* For example when popularity improved to 2 from 1, mean of budget also increased.\n* But when popularity improved to 3 from 2, mean of budget decreased.\n* So we can say that mean of budget directly effect to popularity for comedy category\n\n**Notes:**\n- I selected comedy category to assess budget effects to popularity.\n- When I plotted popularity vs budget with all data, I could not observe a relationship between graphics. \n- Later I decided to categorize popularity to 1,2,3,4,5,6. I calculated mean of budget for each popularity category.\n- Finally I drawed line chart graphic for mean of budget vs popularity range. In this case I could not observe direct relationship between these subjects. We can not say budget increasement improves popularity or opposite.\n- Accordingly my opinion, csv data is enough to evaluate this question but accordingly my observation there is not linear/nonlinear relationship between budget and popularity.\n- When I drawed popularity vs budget graphics I could not observe a relationship. In this case, I felt stuck because I could not find a solution how I can answer this question. Later I thought maybe I can categorize popularity in a range and try to create more clear graphic than first one.
